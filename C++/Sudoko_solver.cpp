/**
 * Problem: Sudoko Solver

/**
 * Explaination:
 * The provided C++ code implements a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functions:
 *
 * Function isPossible:
 * This function checks if placing a character (ch) at position (r, c) on the board is valid.
 * It checks the entire row (r) and column (c) for the presence of ch.
 * It also checks the corresponding 3x3 subgrid to ensure ch is not already present.
 *
 * Function solve:
 * This is a recursive function that attempts to fill the Sudoku board.
 * It takes two parameters, r (current row) and c (current column).
 * If r is 9, it means the board is successfully filled, and it returns true.
 * If c is 9, it means the current row is filled, so it moves to the next row by calling itself with r + 1 and resetting c to 0.
 * If the current cell is not empty (i.e., contains a digit), it moves to the next column by calling itself with c + 1.
 * For empty cells (denoted by '.'), it tries every digit from '1' to '9':
 * If isPossible returns true for a digit, it places the digit in the cell, then recursively calls solve for the next column.
 * If placing the digit leads to a solution, it returns true. If not, it backtracks by resetting the cell to '.'.
 *
